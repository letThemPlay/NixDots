- When home manager fails to build run
```
  $journalctl --unit home-manager-chris.service
```
and check for any file coming in between the creation of a new home-manager generation

* Mako wasn't starting because I had messed up somewhere in the format section in the home manager module.
The error won't be printed out since the config file messed up was the symlinked config file in config 
directory. Gotta be careful when editting the home-manager stuff.
