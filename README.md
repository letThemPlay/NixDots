After installing the system
1. Update to a nixos-unstable channel
2. Enable root user to use GUI applications using xhost (see the ArchWiki for this)

# Notes #
- There is an error in Thunar: "cannot find archive manager" when opening an Archive file.
- Need to do a thorough reading of all the Nix
- Need to set up a notification for low battery power
- Can install nix-colors which will help to rice nix from just one configuration file
- Mako notifications are very short-termed, and gives error with Blueman (so switched to Overskride) because there's no option for confirming the pairing codes.
- Also installed bluetuith for terminal bluetooth control.
- Swaync configuration has not worked for the wifi button
- Enable wlogout
