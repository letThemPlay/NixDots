After installing the system
1. Update to a nixos-unstable channel
2. Enable root user to use GUI applications using xhost (see the ArchWiki for this)

# Notes #
- There is an error in Thunar: "cannot find archive manager" when opening an Archive file.
- Need to do a thorough reading of all the Nix
- Need to set up a notification for low battery power
